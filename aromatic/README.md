# SMILES â†’ Aromatic SMILES Converter with PNG Export  

This project provides a simple Python script to:  

1. **Read a CSV file** containing a column named `SMILE`.  
2. **Convert each SMILES** into its **aromatic SMILES** using RDKIT.  
3. **Save results** into a new CSV file with an additional column `Aromatic_SMILE`.  
4. **Export molecule images (PNG)** into a folder `input-structures/`.
